The predictive power of QFT has been demonstrated with extraordinary precision in the Standard Model of particle physics, which accurately describes electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions.

Global Workspace Theory suggests that consciousness emerges when information is broadcast widely across the brain, becoming available to multiple cognitive systems simultaneously. Higher-Order Theories posit that consciousness requires meta-representations—neural systems that represent other neural states. Recent experimental advances include the development of consciousness-specific neuroimaging signatures that can distinguish between conscious and unconscious processing, identify consciousness in non-communicative patients, and track transitions between conscious states during anesthesia or sleep.

DNA methylation typically involves the addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases in CpG dinucleotides, generally resulting in transcriptional repression when occurring in promoter regions. Histone modifications encompass a diverse array of post-translational alterations to histone protein tails, including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, collectively forming a sophisticated 'histone code' that influences chromatin structure and transcriptional accessibility. Non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, further regulate gene expression through mechanisms including transcript degradation, translational inhibition, and recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes.

Systemic risk analysis employs various metrics including node centrality measures, which identify systemically important institutions based on their structural position within the network; default correlation models, which capture the tendency of multiple entities to fail simultaneously under common shocks; and stress testing methodologies that simulate the network's response to hypothetical adverse scenarios. The 2008 global financial crisis illustrated how traditional regulatory approaches focusing predominantly on individual institutions' risk profiles failed to adequately address emergent system-level vulnerabilities, particularly those arising from counterparty credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives markets, maturity transformation in shadow banking, and the procyclicality of collateralized lending practices.

Replicator dynamics, a central mathematical formalism in the field, describes how the frequency distribution of strategies changes based on their relative payoffs compared to the population average. Research has identified several mechanisms that can sustain cooperation in social dilemmas, including network reciprocity (where cooperation clusters on graphs), group selection (where competition occurs between rather than within groups), and reputation systems (where cooperative behaviors signal trustworthiness to potential partners). Evolutionary models have been particularly influential in explaining the emergence of seemingly irrational human behaviors such as strong reciprocity, costly punishment of norm violators, and parochial altruism toward in-group members.

Causal set theory proposes that continuous spacetime emerges from a discrete set of spacetime events connected by causal relationships, with Lorentz invariance preserved through random spacetime sprinkling. Asymptotic safety explores the possibility that quantum gravitational interactions become effectively weaker at high energies due to a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point in the theory's renormalization group flow.

These cognitive tendencies, while adaptive in ancestral environments with different decision ecologies, can lead to systematic errors in modern contexts involving complex statistical information, long time horizons, or abstract consequences. Debiasing strategies include restructuring decision environments to align heuristic processing with normative objectives, training in statistical reasoning and metacognitive awareness, and designing decision support systems that complement human cognitive strengths while compensating for predictable weaknesses. Recent work explores how cognitive biases manifest differently across cultures, socioeconomic contexts, and developmental stages, revealing both universal patterns and context-dependent variations in human judgment under uncertainty.\"\n  }\n]; "],"mappings":"AAMA,OAAO,MAAMA,SAAqB,GAAG,CACnC;EACEC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,sBAAsB;EAC7BC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,+BAA+B;EACtCC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,wBAAwB;EAC/BC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,yCAAyC;EAChDC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,+BAA+B;EACtCC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,qCAAqC;EAC5CC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,6CAA6C;EACpDC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,qCAAqC;EAC5CC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,KAAK,EAAE,8CAA8C;EACrDC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,KAAK,EAAE,0CAA0C;EACjDC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,KAAK,EAAE,mDAAmD;EAC1DC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,KAAK,EAAE,qDAAqD;EAC5DC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,KAAK,EAAE,+BAA+B;EACtCC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,KAAK,EAAE,2CAA2C;EAClDC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,EACD;EACEF,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,KAAK,EAAE,wDAAwD;EAC/DC,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,CAAC,CACF","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}

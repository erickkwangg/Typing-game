Birds chirped melodiously from the trees, creating a peaceful atmosphere. People walked their dogs along the winding paths, enjoying the beautiful weather. Some sat on benches reading books or simply taking in the scenery. A group of friends played frisbee on the open grass, laughing and having fun together. Nearby, families had spread blankets for picnics, sharing food and conversations. The playground was filled with excited children climbing, sliding, and swinging. Parents watched carefully, occasionally helping the younger ones. An ice cream vendor strolled through, selling cold treats to eager customers on this warm day. The park fountain sprayed water high into the air, creating rainbows when the sunlight hit just right. Joggers followed the track around the park's perimeter, focused on their exercise routines. Elderly couples walked hand in hand, reminiscing about days gone by. A painter sat under a large oak tree, capturing the vibrant scene on canvas. Squirrels darted about, collecting nuts and climbing trees with impressive agility. A local yoga class had gathered on the far side, moving through poses in unison. The community garden section showed off its colorful flowers and thriving vegetables. Teenagers sat in circles, talking animatedly and sharing stories from school. A chess tournament was underway at the stone tables, attracting a crowd of spectators. The butterfly garden was particularly active, with various species fluttering from flower to flower. Children fed the ducks at the pond, carefully tossing bread crumbs into the water. The park's maintenance team worked diligently, ensuring everything remained clean and well-kept.

The air was filled with the scent of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers. It was a perfect day to be outdoors, enjoying nature and community.\"\n}, {\n  id: 2,\n  title: \"Making Chocolate Chip Cookies\",\n  text: \"Baking chocolate chip cookies is a delightful experience that fills your home with wonderful aromas. Start by gathering all your ingredients to make the process smooth and enjoyable. You will need flour, butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips. Preheat your oven to three hundred fifty degrees to ensure it reaches the proper temperature before baking begins. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This usually takes about three minutes with an electric mixer. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition to fully incorporate them into the batter. Stir in the vanilla extract, which adds a rich flavor that complements the chocolate perfectly. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt to distribute the leavening agent evenly. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Over-mixing can lead to tough cookies, so be gentle with the dough at this stage. Fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula, distributing them evenly throughout the cookie dough. For extra chocolatey cookies, feel free to add more chips than the recipe suggests. Use a tablespoon or cookie scoop to portion the dough onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Leave about two inches between each cookie to allow for spreading during baking. Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for about ten to twelve minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still look slightly soft but will firm up as the cookies cool. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely. This prevents them from breaking apart when moved while still hot. Once cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container to maintain freshness. They typically stay good for about a week, though they rarely last that long in most households. For a special treat, try serving the cookies while still warm with a glass of cold milk. The contrast of temperatures creates a wonderful sensory experience. You can also experiment with different types of chocolate chips or add nuts for variety. White chocolate chips and macadamia nuts make a delicious alternative combination. Freezing portions of the cookie dough allows you to bake fresh cookies whenever the craving strikes. Simply form the dough into balls, freeze them on a tray, and then transfer to a freezer bag for storage. When ready to bake, place the frozen dough balls on a baking sheet and add a minute or two to the baking time. No need to thaw first.\"\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  title: \"The History of Bicycles\",\n  text: \"Bicycles have a fascinating history that spans over two centuries. They have evolved significantly from their early designs to become the efficient vehicles we know today. The first documented bicycle was created in Germany in 1817 by Baron Karl von Drais. This early version, called a running machine or draisine, had no pedals. Riders propelled it by pushing their feet against the ground, similar to how we use modern balance bikes for children. The draisine featured two wheels of equal size connected by a wooden frame. Riders would straddle the frame and walk or run to move forward, occasionally lifting their feet to coast. This invention was revolutionary for its time, allowing people to travel faster than walking. In the 1860s, the velocipede or boneshaker appeared in France. This improved design introduced pedals attached directly to the front wheel. While this allowed riders to propel themselves without touching the ground, the rigid iron frame and wooden wheels earned it the nickname boneshaker due to the uncomfortable ride on cobblestone streets. The high-wheel bicycle, also known as the penny-farthing, emerged in the 1870s. It featured a large front wheel and a much smaller rear wheel. The large front wheel allowed riders to travel farther with each pedal rotation, essentially serving as a primitive form of gearing. However, these bicycles were dangerous due to their height and forward center of gravity. Riders often took serious falls, leading to the term taking a header. The safety bicycle, introduced in the 1880s, revolutionized bicycle design with its chain drive and equal-sized wheels. This allowed for efficient power transfer to the rear wheel while keeping both wheels at a manageable size. The basic diamond frame pattern established during this period remains the standard for bicycles today. Pneumatic tires, patented by John Boyd Dunlop in 1888, further improved the riding experience by providing better traction and shock absorption. The early 20th century saw bicycles become an important means of transportation worldwide. Manufacturers began producing more affordable models, making them accessible to working-class individuals. Various specialized designs emerged for different purposes, including delivery bicycles with large carrying baskets or platforms. During both World Wars, bicycles played crucial roles in military operations, serving as quick, quiet transportation for messengers and infantry. After World War II, bicycles became increasingly viewed as recreational vehicles and children's toys in many developed countries, while remaining essential transportation in others. The 1970s brought a bicycle boom in the United States, with increased interest in cycling for fitness and environmental reasons. Mountain biking emerged as a sport in the late 1970s, leading to significant innovation in bicycle design. Today, bicycles continue to evolve with new materials like carbon fiber and electronic components such as power meters and electronic shifting systems.\"\n}];","map":{"version":3,"names":["easyTexts","id","title","text"],"sources":["/Users/ericwang/Theseus/typing-racer/src/data/easyTexts.ts"],"sourcesContent":["export const easyTexts = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    title: \"A Day at the Park\",\n    text: \"The sun shone brightly in the clear blue sky as children played happily in the park.
